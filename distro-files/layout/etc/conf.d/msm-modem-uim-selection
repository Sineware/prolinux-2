# Maximum time to wait for SIM card to appear after starting the modem.
# Some SIM cards or modem firmwares might take longer to initialize. :(
# To avoid blocking boot without a SIM card for too long this is fairly short
# by default (1 second), but you can increase it to e.g. 30 seconds if necessary.
# Set to 0 to disable waiting entirely.
